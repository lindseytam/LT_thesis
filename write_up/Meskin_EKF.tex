\section{Modeling Metabolites using EKF}
\label{Modeling Metabolites using EKF}
\label{chap:EKF_Meskin}

\noindent This example is inspired by research that models the biological pathway of metabolites, which are molecules that are the byproduct of the body's metabolism. This model contains four different states, or metabolites, which contain 17 unknown parameters \cite{article5}. Unlike the original research, which had datasources of their own, this example will simulate data by using a built-in ODE solver on Matlab. The dataset used to generate these results are included along with the code in the appendix. Ultimately, the goals of this example is to demonstrate how the EKF can be applied, how the EKF can correct for multiple variables or states, and how the EKF can be used for parameter fitting. \\ 

\noindent In this example, there are four states. The first state, $x_1$, is the concentration of the CadA enzyme. The second state, $x_2$, is the concentration of the CadBA enzyme. The third state, $x_3$, is the concentration of external lysine. Finally, the fourth state, $x_4$, is the concentration of external cadaverine. These four states have the following differential equations:
\begin{align*}
\dot x_1 &= \alpha_1 x_3^{g_{13}}  - \beta_1 x_1^{h_{11}}, \\
\dot x_2 &= \alpha_2 x_1^{g_{21}} - \beta_2 x_2^{h_{22}}, \\
\dot x_3 &= \alpha_3 x_2^{g_{32}} - \beta_3 x_3^{h_{33}} x_4^{h_{34}}, \\
\dot x_4 &= \alpha_4  x_1^{g_{41}} - \beta_4 x_4^{h_{44}},
\end{align*}
where there are 17 unknown parameters ($\alpha_1, \hdots, \alpha_4, \beta_1, \hdots, \beta_4, g_{13}, g_{21}, \\ g_{32}, g_{41}, h_{11}, h_{22}, h_{33}, h_{34}, h_{44} $) and the state vector is given by $x= [x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4}]^T$. For now, we will use the true value of these parameters (which can be found in \cite{article5}), but later on the EKF will be applied for parameter estimation. In both the original example as well as this one, sampling time will be 0.1 seconds for 5 seconds, totaling 50 EKF estimates. \\

\subsubsection{Implementing EKF}

Recall that implementing the EKF requires initializing the model, generating a prediction, and correcting the prediction. Below outlines the process of how the EKF can be applied for a single time step. Applying the EKF to multiple time steps is simulated on Matlab, and the code for doing so can be found in the appendix.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The model is initialized by setting the state variable to $x_0 = [4, 1, 3, 4]^T$, which is very close to the true values of the system. Since the initialized state has values near the true value, the state covariance can also be set to a lower value of $P_0 = .01I$. 
\item The next step is to generate a prediction. To do so, the system must be discretized into time steps. The system is given in a continuous state space in the form of $\dot x = Ax$, and can be discretized by converting it into the form $\dot x = e^{At}x$. However, in this system, calculating the matrix exponential is computationally intense (taking days to run on a single iteration on Matlab). Therefore, the Euler method will be used with a time step of 0.05 seconds, resulting in
\begin{align*}
 x_{1|0} &=  x_{0|0} + 0.05  * f(x) \\ \\
&= \begin{bmatrix}
4 \\
1\\
3 \\
4
\end{bmatrix} + 0.05
\begin{bmatrix}
 \alpha_1 3^{g_{13}} - \beta_1 4 ^{h_{11}} \\
 \alpha_2 4^{g_{21}} - \beta_2 1^{h_{22}} \\
 \alpha_3 1^{g_{32}} - \beta_3 3^{h_{33}} 4^{h_{34}} \\
\alpha_4  4^{g_{41}} - \beta_4 4^{h_{44}}
\end{bmatrix} \\ \\
&=\begin{bmatrix}
3.4152 \\
1.6500 \\
2.5786 \\
3.2906
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{align*}

\item Finally, the prediction can be corrected. Calculate $F$, the jacobian of the nonlinear transformation $f=[\dot x_1, \dot x_2, \dot x_3, \dot x_4]^T$, and $H$, the Jacobian of the nonlinear observation function $h=[\dot x_1, \dot x_2, \dot x_3, \dot x_4]^T$, as follows
\begin{align*}
F = H = 
\begin{bmatrix}
-\beta_1 h_{11} x_1^{h_{11}-1} & 0 & x_5 x_3 g_{13} ^{g_{13}-1}& 0 \\
\alpha_2  g_{21} x_1^{g_{21}-1} & -\beta_2 h_{22} x_2^{h_{22}-1}&0&0\\
0&\alpha_3 g_{32} x_2^{g_{32}-1} & -\beta_3 h_{33} x_3^{h_{33}-1} x_4^{h_{34}}&-\beta_3 h_{34} x_4^{h_{34}-1} x_3^{h_{33}}\\
\alpha_4 g_{41} x_1^{g_{41}-1}&0&0&-\beta_4 h_{44} x_4^{h_{44}-1}
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{align*}




\noindent  $H$ should be adjusted according to how many states are being corrected. For instance, if correction is being done for all states, $H$ should remain as it is above. However, if only the first state is being corrected, then $h = [\dot x_1]$ and $H = [-\beta_1 h_{11} x_1^{h_{11}-1},  0,  x_3 g_{13} ^{g_{13}-1}, 0 ]$. \\

\noindent Assuming that the first state is the only state being corrected, $F$ and $H$ are used to calculate the Kalman Gain, which is 
\begin{align*}
K_1 = 
\begin{bmatrix}
.05402 & -.0370 & .0465 & .0149
\end{bmatrix}^T.
\end{align*}

\noindent Additionally, the prediction can be transformed in order to compare it with incoming system measurement. In the case where only the first state is being predicted, the prediction is transformed by applying the nonlinear observation function to the prediction. Similar to generating the prediction, this can be done by using Euler's method to discretize the system, resulting in
\begin{align*}
y_{1} &=  x_{1,1|0} + 0.05 * h(x_{1|0}) \\ 
&=3.4152  + 0.05(\alpha_1 2.5786 ^{g_{13}} - \beta_1 3.4152  ^{h_{11}} )=
2.9600.
\end{align*}

\noindent This transformed value is quite close to the measured value of 3.1126, meaning that in the first time step, the residual is approximately .15. Recall that the measured value was simulated on Matlab and can be found in the appendix.\\

\noindent Finally, the prediction can be corrected, resulting in
\begin{align*}
 x_{1|1}&=
  x_{1|0} + K_1 (y_1 - \hat y_1) =
\begin{bmatrix}
3.5751\\
1.5404 \\
2.7162 \\
3.3346
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{align*}

\end{enumerate}

\noindent Applying the EKF for 50 time steps by repeating steps 2 and 3 on Matlab results in Figure \ref{fig:EKF_1state}. The black lines are the true values of the system, the blue lines are the EKF estimates, and the green lines is the measured values. Only State 1 has a green line because only the State 1 was measurable. These accuracy of the EKF on each of these states is performing as expected. Notice that initially, the EKF performance on State 1 is influenced by the system measurements, but later on it becomes less influenced by the measurements and converges with the true. Out of all four states, the EKF performed best on State 1 because that was the state the system was correcting for.  State 2 and State 4 performed fairly well, with some misalignments in the first 2 seconds but converging with the true values later on. This is because the ODEs in State 2 and State 4 contain State 1. On the other hand, state 3 had the worst performance and only converges towards the end. This is because State 3 does not contain State 1 in its ODE.  \\

\begin{figure}[ht]

    \includegraphics[scale = 0.24]{EKF_1state.png}
    \caption{The result of implementing EKF with correction applied to State 1 and initialized with states $[4, 1, 3, 4]^T$. State 1 has the best performance, because it is the only state that is measurable. Since State 2 and 4 are dependent on State 1, they perform fairly well, though they do not converge as quickly as State 1. State 3 is independent of State 1, and performs the most poorly.}

\noindent Multiple state correction is similar to the implementation above. The only difference is in the correction step, where the value of $h$ differs. Notice the improvement in performance when all states are being corrected, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:EKF_4state}. The black lines represent the true values of the system, the blue line is the EKF estimate, and the green line is the measured values.  Since all states are being corrected for at the same time, all four states quickly converge to their true values. \\

\noindent For more examples on applying the EKF and MATLAB code, the following can be referenced \cite{cao_2008, article7}.

    \caption{The results of using the EKF with correction applied to all states using a model initialized with states $[4, 1, 3, 4]^T$. Since all states are measurable, correction is being applied to all states, resulting in all of the states quickly converging to their true values.}
    \label{fig:EKF_4state}
  \end{figure}

\noindent Part of the reason that the EKF performance is so accurate is because this system does not have many dimensions and the nonlinearity of the system was not too complex. Most real world systems will have greater than 4 states that are represented by more complex ODEs. Also, the way them model was initialized helped the system converge quicker. For instance, the initialized states of this model are extremely close to the system's true values. In addition, the measurement noise value of $R=0.01$ is very small, which assumes that the variation of noise is not high. These factors contribute to the accuracy in performance of this particular example.

\subsubsection{EKF Parameter Estimation}
The EKF (as well as other versions of the Kalman Filter), can be utilized for parameter estimation. There are many methods of parameter estimation, which include using dual techniques. In fact, there is a nonlinear version of the Kalman Filter, called the Dual Unscented Kalman Filter, that was designed in order to simultaneously monitor state and parameter values. Though this thesis does not explore these methods, more information can be found in \cite{inbook, article6}. In particular, this thesis explores the use of joint parameter estimation. This technique involves creating new states for each of the unknown parameters. \\ 

\noindent In this example, the goal is to use the EKF to find parameter values that best fit this model to its true states. This example continues to use the metabolites system with the goal of estimating parameter $\alpha_1$. Begin by declaring $\alpha_1$ as a separate state. The new set of differential equations for this 5 state system is given by
\begin{align*}
\dot x_1 &= x_5 x_3^{g_{13}} - \beta_1 x_1^{h_{11}}, \\
\dot x_2 &= \alpha_2 x_1^{g_{21}} - \beta_2 x_2^{h_{22}}, \\
\dot x_3 &= \alpha_3 x_2^{g_{32}} - \beta_3 x_3^{h_{33}} x_4^{h_{34}}, \\
\dot x_4 &= \alpha_4  x_1^{g_{41}} - \beta_4 x_4^{h_{44}}\\
\dot x_5 &= 0.
\end{align*}


\noindent The ODE for $x_5$ is 0, because $x_5$ is a parameter, or constant, and does not change overtime. In this 5 state system, the nonlinear state transition function is equal to $f = [\dot x_1, \dot x_2, \dot x_3, \dot x_4, \dot x_5]^T$. \\


\noindent By applying the EKF to this system while correcting for all 5 states, the EKF performs well, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:EKF_1param}. The black lines represent the true values of the system while the blue lines represents the performance of the EKF. Though all of these states were measurable, the measured values are not shown on the graph . This example is assuming that the parameter $a_1$ is measurable; while this can occur, it should not be expected that all parameters are measurable. The performance of all 5 states is fairly accurate, with all states quickly converging to their true values. \\

\newpage

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale = 0.24]{EKF_1param.png}
    \caption{Results obtained by implementing the EKF with parameter estimation of $\alpha_1$. The model is initialized with $[4, 1, 3, 4, 20]^T$, which is close to the true initial value of the system. While not depicted in this visual, the model still performs well when initialized with values further from the true system values. }
    \label{fig:EKF_1param}
\end{figure}


\noindent A large factor to the accuracy of this model is the fact that all states are being corrected for and the fact that the model was initialized with values near the true values. Though not shown in this thesis, using values further from the true values still led to convergence, just at a slower rate. Hypothetically, if only State 3 was being corrected for, then it would be expected that parameter estimation of $a_1$ would be very poor, because State 3 has no relation to $a_1$.

\noindent Parameter estimation can be applied to more than one parameter. In this example, consider parameter estimation for four states, $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4$. This introduces four new states into the original four state system, resulting in an 8 state system with the following ODES:
\begin{align*}
\dot x_1 &= x_5  x_3^{g_{13}} - \beta_1 x_1^{h_{11}} , \\
\dot x_2 &= x_6  x_1^{g_{21}} - \beta_2 x_2^{h_{22}}, \\

\noindent The results of the EKF when applied to this 8 state system is shown in figure ~\ref{fig:4param}. The black line represents the true values of the system, while the blue line represents the EKF estimate. Since all 8 states are being corrected, the EKF performs well, with the states and parameters converging to their true values. Another reason for the system's quick convergence is because the model is initialized with values close to the true system values. Using initial values that are further from the true values still results in convergence, but at a slower rate. \\

\noindent After 50 time-steps, the EKF prediction of these four parameter is quite close to their true values, as shown in Table ~\ref{tab:4param}. Parameter $a_1$ seems to have the most accurate EKF estimate while parameter $a_4$ has the least accurate estimate, as compared to the other parameters. This table also includes the results from the Iterated Unscented Kalman Filter (IUKF), which was the original method used in \cite{article5}. Based on these results, the IUKF performs slightly better than the EKF. However, it is important to keep in mind that these results are not based on the same dataset. The IUKF uses actual data while the EKF uses simulated data.

However, keep in mind that the EKF estimate and the IUKF estimate uses different system measurements because we do not have access to the original dataset.}

\noindent In conclusion, this example illustrates how the EKF can be implemented on a nonlinear dynamical system by modeling  the pathway of metabolites, which are represented by a four state system. The EKF can be implemented after discretizing the continuous system using Euler's method. After it is in its state space format, the EKF can be applied to generate a prediction. The prediction is corrected by incorporating incoming measurements, which was done for one state and for all states. As expected, the model performs better when more states re being corrected, but still performs well when just one state is corrected. The results from this example perform well because this system has only 4 states, the ODEs are not too nonlinear, and the model is initialized with values near its true values. \\

\noindent This example also demonstrates how the EKF can be used in joint parameter estimation. Joint parameter estimation involves creating new states for the parameters to be estimated. Here, we applied two examples of joint parameter estimation: one with a single parameter and one with 4 parameters. In both examples, the EKF was able to generate a prediction that is very close to the true parameter values. This is likely because we are assuming that the entire system is measurable, including the parameters. Another factor for this model's performance is because it is initialized with values close to the true values of the system.  




\comment{
\noindent Residuals, also known as the innovation, are one way to access the model's performance. Recall that the residual is the difference between the actual measurement values and the predicted measurement values. Generally, a strong residual graph has

\begin{itemize}
\item a symmetrical distribution that is clustered toward the center,
\item values that are close to 0,
\item a random or unclear pattern.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Figure ~\ref{fig:4params} is the residual graph of the system where the EKF is applied to the four states and four parameters, $\alpha_1, \hdots, \alpha_4$. While this residual graph has values close to 0 and a symmetrical distribution, the pattern is similar to the behavior of the states. Therefore, though EKF can be applied to this nonlinear system, performance can be further optimized.

\noindent There are many methods of parameter estimation, which include using dual techniques. In fact, there is a nonlinear version of the Kalman Filter, called the Dual Unscented Kalman Filter, that was designed in order to simultaneously monitor state and parameter values.
