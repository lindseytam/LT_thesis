Relying on limited amounts of information / parameters in order to determine multiple states (that do not have actual measurements)

How do we get more information about states

For each oberservation, look to see which has most information about parameters
ex: from state , learned x parameters

Think about what data we want to measure (we want info from state 1 or state 2?)

Graph residuals to determine "best fit" for states

Introduce ODE in step1 of the ODE (dx/dt = f)

Move tablet o bottom

Include more diagrams (of all) - powerpoint okay

Check relationship between process noise and measurement noise (Undergrad paper)


Hat indicates estimate, be more clear in writeup

Write out E is the expectation of a Gaussian distribution

Be more explicit about the first step (what is the expectation fo?)

m_0, c_0 are guesses, 



Process noise is normaly distributed between 0, sigma points, 

Measurement noise is normally distributed between 0 and guess - check for assumptions

Clarify distributions,
